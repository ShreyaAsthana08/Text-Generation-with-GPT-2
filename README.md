# Text-Generation-with-GPT-2
Train a model to generate
coherent and contextually
relevant text based on a given
prompt. Starting with GPT- 2, a
transformer model developed by
OpenAI, you will learn how to fine-
tune the model on a custom
dataset to create text that mimics
the style and structure of your
training data


This project focuses on training a model to generate **coherent and contextually relevant text** based on a given prompt using **GPT-2**, a transformer-based language model developed by OpenAI.
## ðŸ“Œ Project Objectives

- Understand how GPT-2 works for Natural Language Generation (NLG)
- Generate creative, fluent, and context-aware text outputs
- Explore the power of Generative AI using Hugging Faceâ€™s Transformers


## ðŸ§° Tech Stack & Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
